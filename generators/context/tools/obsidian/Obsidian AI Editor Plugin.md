# Obsidian AI Editor Plugin

The Obsidian AI Editor Plugin is a powerful tool that integrates artificial intelligence capabilities into the Obsidian App. With this plugin, you can enhance your writing, research, and brainstorming processes by leveraging AI-generated suggestions and content. Whether you're looking for creative prompts, relevant information, or grammar improvements, the AI Editor Plugin has you covered.

# Features
- AI-Powered Processing: Ask LLM to process your documents, easily integrated inside Obsidian. 
- Unlock Your Creativity: The plugin is designed to be configurable and fit your need. It's easy to create your own command and integrate LLM as part of workflow.
- Text-summarization (Demo): We configured text summarization command to demonstrate the plugin.

# Usage

5. Note that you need to reload the app to get new command registered for now.
